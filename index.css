/* Since you are using CDN in HTML, these directives might not be processed if postcss is not set up, 
   but it is good practice to have them if you switch to local build. 
   
   However, the HTML uses <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index.css">.
   If using pure CSS without build step for CSS, we can put custom styles here.
